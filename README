A solution to a simple quiz I gave to my students.
---

So I gave a quiz to my students and for some reason, I got an itch to code a solution.

The quiz is this:

Make a tkinter application that has one label which contains "Are you a boy or a girl?". There are two buttons with the Mars and Venus gender symbols. Clicking either one will acknowledge the user.

I did not want to include the images I created in paint. So I encoded them as base64. This also allow the entire solution to exist in only one file (instead of 1 python code + 2 images).

Btw, to those who didn't get the reference, you need to play more videogames. Hmmm, maybe this is why I got an itch to answer my own quiz. :p
